## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before setting up Agent UI, you may want to have an Agno Playground running. If you haven't set up the Agno Playground yet, follow the [official guide](https://agno.link/agent-ui#connect-to-local-agents) to run the Playground locally.

### Installation

### Automatic Installation (Recommended)

```bash
npx create-agent-ui@latest
```

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-ui.git
cd agent-ui
```

2. Install dependencies:

Using pnpm:
```bash
pnpm install
```

Using bun:
```bash
bun install
```

3. Start the development server:

Using pnpm:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Using bun:
```bash
bun run dev
```

To restart
```bash
pkill -f "next dev" 2>/dev/null
```

To clean cache (pnpm)
```bash
pnpm store prune && rm -rf .next && pnpm run dev
```

To clean cache (bun)
```bash
rm -rf .next && bun run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Connecting to an Agent Backend

By default Agent UI connects to `http://localhost:7777`. You can easily change this by hovering over the endpoint URL and clicking the edit option.

The default endpoint works with the standard Agno Playground setup described in the [official documentation](https://agno.link/agent-ui#connect-to-local-agents).
